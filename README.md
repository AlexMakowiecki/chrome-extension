# Chrome extension practice
## What is it? 
It's an extension that helps you list and save links across the browser. It's a practice project to learn how to make extensions for Chrome, that is almost the same as doing a website. 
It's also the fifth project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 3, where they teach you how to use Javascript.
## What did I use?
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and a manifest.json with the information needed for Chrome to detail the extension. 
## Concepts learned for this project and practiced during it.
  - **const** to declare constant variables that will not change throughout the rest of the code, or that shouldn't.
  - **addEventListener()** to link events with HTML elements, and run a function when they are activated. 
  - **innerHTML** to replace the HTML content of an HTML element. 
  - **input.value** to take or replace the value written inside of an input element. 
  - **function parameters** to send data inside of a function from outside of its scope. 
  - **template strings** to make complex strings, like ones with a lot of variables, in a more simple way. 
  - **localStorage** to store information that not will be lost when the page is reloaded. 
    - `localStorage.setItem("varName", "stringifiedVarValue")` `localStorage.getItem("varName")` `localStorage.clear()`
  - **JSON object:** a stringified object used to store information. In this case, it's used for the manifest.json and for parsing objects into strings in JavaScript, such as the value passed to localStorage
## How you can use it
You have to go to Chrome's "manage extensions" tab  and click the **Load unpacked** button, in the route you have to put the folder containing all of the files of this repository.
